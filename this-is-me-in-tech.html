                (This paragraph will explore cool jobs in technology.) 
            </p>
            <p>I think technology is really cool, and I want to learn everything I can about it! I already like HTML, coding, and web design, and one day, I want to make my own apps. I think it would be awesome to build websites for Native businesses and create apps that help my community. Tech jobs like web developer, software engineer, and game designer sound fun because you get to build things that people use every day. I know that learning to code will give me a lot of opportunities, and I’m excited to keep learning and creating!</p>

                (This paragraph will explore when the student learns to code.)
            </p>
            <p>When I learn to code, I can see myself building something amazing. Maybe I’ll create a website that shares stories from my Tribe or an app that helps people learn our language. I can picture myself working on a big project, writing code that makes everything run smoothly. Maybe I’ll design a video game that shows Native heroes and legends, or even start my own tech company one day. The possibilities are endless! Coding will let me turn my ideas into real things, and I can’t wait to see what I’ll create. I will travel the world. I will make new friends. I will learn so much.</p>

                (This paragraph will explore how learning tech can help the student’s Tribe and community.)
            </p>
            <p>When I learn to code, I want to use my skills to help my Tribe and community. I can build websites for Native-owned businesses, create apps that connect people with important resources, or design online lessons to teach our language and history. Technology can make life easier and bring people together, and I want to make sure my community has access to those opportunities. One day, I hope to teach other Native youth how to code so we can all build a stronger future together!
